    "You find a suitable location to set up a trap, using the natural resources of the forest to camouflage it seamlessly within the surroundings."
    "There, amidst a vibrant carpet of fallen leaves, a playful cub frolics with joy. The air is filled with the sound of its carefree dance and rustling leaves. You whistle to get Wilson's attention to look at the cub amongst the golden foliage."
